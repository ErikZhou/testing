WebAssembly Consensus
WebAssembly CG members representing four browsers, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and WebKit, have reached consensus that the design of the initial (MVP) WebAssembly API and binary format is complete to the extent that no further design work is possible without implementation experience and significant usage.
